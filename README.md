Project Description

Swing-based Java Application on Railway Reservation System
The Application involves:
• User Authentication
(Signup/Login Details stored in Database using MySQL)
• Ticket Reservation
• Ticket Details stored in the Database
• Digital Ticket PDF is generated

Details of Development
• Java Programming Language: The system is developed using Java, which provides
object-oriented programming features, making it suitable for building scalable and
maintainable applications.
• Swing GUI Toolkit: Swing is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI)
components for the reservation system, allowing for the creation of interactive and
visually appealing interfaces.
• MySQL Database: MySQL is employed as the database management system (DBMS)
to store and manage user information, reservations, and other relevant data.
• JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): JDBC is utilized to establish a connection
between the Java application and the MySQL database, enabling data retrieval,
insertion, and manipulation.
• iText and PDF Generation: The iText library is employed to generate PDF tickets
dynamically, providing users with a printable confirmation of their reservation details.
